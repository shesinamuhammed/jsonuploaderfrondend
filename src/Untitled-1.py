b = [3,4,5]
a.append(b)


arr = [23,72,45,56,34,26,36,54,34,58]
In above question find second highest element.

a= []
for  i in range (1,arr+1):
   a = arr.sort()
   print(a[-2])
    
    
    Count the occurrence of each element from a list

Sample input :
sample_list = [11, 45, 8, 11, 23, 45, 23, 45, 89]

Sample output :
Printing count of each item {11: 2, 45: 3, 8: 1, 23: 2, 89: 1}


count = 0
for i in range sample_list(i):
    
    db.collectionnanem.aggregate({})
